## Roadmap
- [x] PoC on linux
- [ ] Research competitors
- [ ] PoC UX on firefox extension (hardcoded rates, but all buttons and popups work as intended)

## Good competitors
- [Direct Currency Converter](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/direct-currency-converter-2/)
  - 6 years without updates, it's now buggy but still works!
  - UX-relates reviews are useful (request for some more settings and intuitive set up)
- [Quick Currency Converter](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/quick-currency-converter/)
  - core features are almost the same as I planned
  - reviews shows that users wants popup ans context menu item features
