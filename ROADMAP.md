## Roadmap

- [x] Coinmarketcap api as crypto rates provider
- [x] Add 'switch favorites' command
- [ ] Add 'convert' command (to convert selected amount of favorite "from" to favorite "to")
- [ ] Add 'set amount from' and 'reset amount from to 1' commands
- [ ] Fix bug with reading 0,9392 as 9 392

## Good competitors
- [Direct Currency Converter](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/direct-currency-converter-2/)
  - 6 years without updates, it's now buggy but still works!
  - UX-relates reviews are useful (request for some more settings and intuitive set up)
- [Quick Currency Converter](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/quick-currency-converter/)
  - core features are almost the same as I planned
  - reviews shows that users wants popup ans context menu item features
